## Motivation
A blockchain offers a means to maintain a decentralized, distributed digital ledger through validation, verification, consensus, and immutability. 
The fundamental building blocks of a blockchain is what its name is in the literal sense - a chain of blocks that contain data. 
This entry is an attempt to make a concrete case of the blockchain by breaking down & implement its logical components. 
To wrap things up, we'll piece the components together and have them work in tandem.
