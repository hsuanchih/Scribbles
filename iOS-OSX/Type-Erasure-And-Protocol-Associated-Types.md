# Type Erasure & Protocol with Associated Types
---
Generics have always played an important part in languages that support polymorphism. 
They provide a means to code reusability without compromising for type safety. 
We will look at how generic types are converted to specific types at compile time via type erasure, and the limitations for protocols that support generic types in Swift.

## Generics in Swift
Generics in Swift approximates to generics in other languages syntactically and semantically for the most part - Enums, Classes & Structs:
